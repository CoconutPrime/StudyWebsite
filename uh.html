  <h4>Rule 1. Use commas to separate items in a list of three or more items</h4>

  <li> Mandy had to finish her homework, cook, and complete her chores</li>

</ul>  

  <h4>Rule 2. Use commas between coordinate adjectives</h4>
  <ul>
  <li> We saw a happy lively pug</li>
  <li>We saw a young golden retriever</li>

  <ul>
  <li>We saw a happy and lively pug </li>
  <li>We saw a young and golden retriever</li>  
</ul> 
 
<h4>Second, try reversing the adjectives around</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>We saw a lively happy pug </li>
  <li>We saw a golden young retriever (This does not make sense when it is reversed, so it does not need a comma)</li>
