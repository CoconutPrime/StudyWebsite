<table style="width:100%">
  
<tr>	 
<td>Point</td>	<td>A location in space. (Ex.A dot on a piece of paper.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>	
<td>Line</td>	<td>Connects two point. (Ex.The shortest path and continues indefinitely (forever) in both directions</td>
</tr>



<tr>	
<td>Line Segment</td> 	<td>Part of a line between two points</td> 
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Perpendicular Line Segment</td> 	<td>Line Segments that intersect (cross) at an angle of 90°</td> 
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Parallel Line Segments</td> 	<td>Line segments that never intersect (they are always the same distance apart)</td> 
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Right Angle</td> 	<td>An angle that measures 90°</td>
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Acute Angle</td> 	<td>An angle that measures less than 90°</td>
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Obtuse Angle</td> 	<td>An angle that measures more than 90°</td> 
</tr>
	

<tr>
<td>Vertex</td> 	<td>Point at which two line segments intersect (forming an angle)</td>
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Scalene Triangle</td> 	<td>A triangle with all three sides with different lengths</td>	
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Isosceles Triangle</td> 	<td>A triangle with two equal length sides (and two equal internal angles)</td> 
</tr>
	

<tr>
<td>Equilateral Triangle</td> 	<td>A triangle with all three sides of equal length (each internal angles = 60°)</td> 	
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Radius</td> 	<td>Distance (line segment) from center of a circle to any point on that circle's circumference.</td> 	
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Diameter</td> 	<td>A line segment (or length) joining two points on a circles circumference and passes through the circle's center (twice the length of the radius)</td> 
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Circumference</td> <td>Distance around a circle (the perimeter)</td>
</tr>


<tr>	
<td>Chord</td> 	<td>A line segment joining two points on a curve.</td>
</tr>
 	

<tr>
<td>Arc</td> 	<td>Part of a curve</td> 	
</tr>
